# Pentest-Scripts-Study
These three codes were developed during the New Professional Pentest course:

jojesdeos.c is a simple C code for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that I used to bring down an FTP server.

portnocker.c is a C code that performs port knocking on specific ports for the course lab.

parsing.sh is a Bash code that performs HTML parsing.
